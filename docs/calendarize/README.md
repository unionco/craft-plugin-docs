## Usage

There are two ways to use the calendarize field in your templates.

### Normal craft queries

- When querying entries from craft you have the ability to access the calendarize field as you would with any other field.

    ```twig
        {% set events = craft.entries({ section: 'events' }).all %}
        {% for event in events %}
            {{ event.calendarizeHandle|date('Y-m-d' }} // __toString returns the next occurrence
            {{ event.calendarizeHandle.next|date('Y-m-d') }} // same as above
            {{ event.calendarizeHandle.startDate|date('Y-m-d') }} // original start date
            {{ event.calendarizeHandle.endDate|date('Y-m-d') }} // original end date
            {{ event.calendarizeHandle.ends }} // boolean if repeat ends
            {{ event.calendarizeHandle.repeats }} // boolean if entry repeats
            {{ event.calendarizeHandle.allDay }} // boolean all day entry
            {{ event.calendarizeHandle.repeatType }} // string type of repeat
            {{ event.calendarizeHandle.hasPassed }} // boolean if entry next occurrence has passed
            {{ event.calendarizeHandle.readable }} // string see rrule for more information
            {{ event.calendarizeHandle.getIcsUrl }} // url to ics controller action for a single eevent
            {{ event.calendarizeHandle.getCalendarIcsUrl }} // url to ics controller action for all events in the section

            // new as of 1.2.12
            {{ event.calendarizeHandle.next.start|date('Y-m-d') }} // next occurrence start date
            {{ event.calendarizeHandle.next.end|date('Y-m-d') }} // next occurrence end date
        {% endfor %}
    ```

- There is also a few added methods to help get all occurrences for repeating entries. These helpers will return an array of `Occurrence` models.

    ```twig
        {% set occurrences = event.calendarizeHandle.getOccurrences(limit) %} {# limit is optional and defaults to 10 #}
        {% set occurrences = event.calendarizeHandle.getOccurrencesBetween(start, end, limit) %} {# limit is optional and defaults to 1 #}
        {% for occurrence in occurrences %}
            {{ occurrence.next|date('Y-m-d') }}
        {% endfor %}
    ```

### The calendarize query way

- Using the calendarize query variable will return all occurrences for all entries that match your criteria. This query returns an array of `Occurrence` models. You still have access to the parent element as you would with the craft query way. 

    ```twig
        {% set monthStart = '2022-01-01' %}
        {% set monthEnd = '2022-01-31' %}
        {% set occurrences = craft.calendarize.between(monthStart, monthEnd, { section: ['liveShows'] }) %}
        {% for occurrence in occurrences %}
            {{ occurrence.title }} @ {{ occurrence.start | date('Y-m-d h:i a') }} - {{ occurrence.end | date('Y-m-d h:i a') }}
        {% endfor %}
    ```

### Other Examples:
- This queries entries with calendarize fields with upcoming occurrences. Can take any normal criteria, order (asc, desc) and a unique parameter. The unique param will limit occurrences to 1 per entry instead of listing all the occurrences. Returns array of entries.

    ```twig
        {% set order = 'asc' %} // defaults to asc
        {% set unique = true %} // defaults to false 
        {% set entries = craft.calendarize.upcoming({ section: ['events'] }, order, unique) %}
    ```

- This queries entries with calendarize fields with occurrences after the provided date. Can take any normal criteria, order and a unique parameter. The unique param will limit occurrences to 1 per entry instead of listing all the occurrences.. Returns array of entries.
    
    ```twig
        {% set order = 'asc' %} // defaults to asc
        {% set unique = true %} // defaults to false 
        {% set entries = craft.calendarize.after('2019-01-04', { section: ['events'] }, order, unique) %}
    ```

- This queries entries with calendarize fields with occurrences between the provided dates. Can take any normal criteria, order and a unique parameter. The unique param will limit occurrences to 1 per entry instead of listing all the occurrences.. Returns array of entries.
    
    ```twig
        {% set order = 'asc' %} // defaults to asc
        {% set unique = true %} // defaults to false 
        {% set entries = craft.calendarize.between('2019-01-01', '2019-01-31', { section: ['events'] }, order, unique) %}
    ```


### Getting ICS URLs (advanced)

- The following options can be passed to customize ICS files:

- For a single event: 

    ```twig
        <a href="{{ event.getIcsUrl({
            filename: 'my-event' //Specify the filename for the generated ICS file
        }) }}">Add to Calendar</a>
    ```
        
- For all events in a calendar: 
 
    ```twig
        <a href="{{ event.getCalendarIcsUrl({
            filename: 'my-calendar', //Specify the filename for the generated ICS file
            relatedTo: 'category-id' //Only included events related to an element id
        }) }}">Subscribe</a>
    ```

## Dependencies 

- RRULE
    - This plugin leverages the use of the PHP RRule library. Docs for this can be found here [PHP RRule](https://github.com/rlanvin/php-rrule). The `rrule` method returns the pre configured rrule with all its available methods. In addition, the `getOccurrences` method returns all occurrences of the entry with a `limit` of 10 by default and the `getOccurrencesBetween` returns the occurence between 2 dates. If the end date is null, it will not enforce the end date and give all occurence greater than the start date provided.

---
## Calendarize Roadmap

### Matrix Support
Although the calendarize field _can_ be used in a Matrix Block context, the occurence queries (`upcoming`, `after`, `between`) will not find those elements. Currently, we are just using the `EntryQuery` to populate occurrences. We are working on a way to allow for querying of Matrix data as well.
